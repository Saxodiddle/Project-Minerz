# Project-Minerz

This project is intended to serve as a learning experience for my friends and I. By having a clear goal of what we want to create,
we can learn the fundamentals of Unity and C#. The core mechanics of Mineralz Evolution are detailed below, and will serve as a guiding 
point of sorts in our development process. Since the current stage of development is very low or otherwise rudimentary, this README will 
only detail the direction that we want the game to go in.

Mineralz Evolution is a custom game in Starcraft II, and is a sort of tower defense game. Players spawn in the middle of a map with 
4 quadrants of randomly generated rocks and minerals in each quadrant. Players decide which quadrant to construct their base in, and 
navigate around and carve out areas within the rocks to create space for their base. Players then construct buildings that serve 
different purposes for maintaining the defense of the base, such as walls, cannons, healers, and power generators. The game runs on 
a day/night cycle, which creates pressure on the players to have a functioning base by nighttime, which is when enemies start spawning.

Players mine and extract resources from the randomly generated mineral fields spawned between rocks. They use these minerals to construct
the previously mentioned buildings, as well as upgrading them. An important part of the game is choosing when to spend your minerals on 
mining speed upgrades (to mine and collect resources faster) or upgrading your buildings.

In Mineralz Evolution, every 5 nights is a "boss night." A boss will spawn instead of a multitude of weaker enemies. Each boss clear
should be considered a milestone in a single match of the game. As such, boss rounds are difficult. They "weed out" weak bases that aren't
as strong as they could be. This rewards players for playing well. A match ends after night 50, which is considered the final boss night. 
While this is something that we could emulate, this mechanic can be changed.
